# Nexus #

Vision
-------
The Nexus is a middleware that aims to bridge the gaps between Stratus.hr, RepairQ, and Gsuite in order to make the onboarding process more efficient. Utilizing
the new (actively being developed) Stratus API, the Nexus creates various Excel sheets in order to allow the onboarding IT Tech to mass import new hires into
RepairQ. To alleviate the limitations and manual inputs RepairQ requires, the Nexus handles setting new hire permissions for each location they may or may not
need access to.

<h3>WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
In its finished state, the Nexus should be able to run daily, create RepairQ account and set permissions, create company gmail account, as well as send out new 
hire emails.
